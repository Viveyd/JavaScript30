    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.log("Players Array", players)

    const playersCopy1 = players.slice();
    console.log(`const playersCopy1 = players.slice();`);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(`const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);`);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const playersCopy3 = [... players];
    console.log(`const playersCopy3 = [... players];`);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    playersCopy1[0] = "byCopy1";
    playersCopy2[1] = "byCopy2";
    playersCopy3[2] = "byCopy3";

    console.log(`playersCopy1[0] = "byCopy1";`)
    console.log(`playersCopy2[1] = "byCopy2";`)
    console.log(`playersCopy3[2] = "byCopy3";`)

    console.log("Still no change to Players array", players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    console.log("Person Object", person);
    // and think we make a copy:
    const personCopy1 = {... person};
    const personCopy2 = Object.assign({}, person);

    console.log(`const personCopy1 = {... person};`)
    console.log(`const personCopy2 = Object.assign({}, person);`)

    personCopy1.name = "name from personCopy1";
    personCopy2.age = "age from personCopy2";

    console.log(`personCopy1.name = "name from personCopy1";`)
    console.log(`personCopy2.age = "age from personCopy2";`)

    console.log(`Still, Person Obj`, person);

    console.log("Above were examples of creating Deep Copies!")


    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
